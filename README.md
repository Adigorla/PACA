Phenotype Aware Components Analysis (PACA) is a contrastive learning approach leveraging canonicalcorrelation analysis to robustly capture weak sources of subphenotypic variation. PACA can be used to define *de novo* subtypes that are more likely to reflect molecular heterogeneity, especially in challenging cases where the phenotypic heterogeneity may be masked by a myriad of strong unrelated effects in the data.

## Installation
